## Welcome to Rose's Lab 1

In this lab I installed all of the requiremented softwares needed for this course. This included GitHub, Postman, VS Code.
After these were installed, I praticed using commands in my terminal. I learned how to create a folder using the "mkdir" command. I also learned that the "ls" command will list the contents of a folder for you. 

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts make life much easier for a coder and so in this lab we pratciced using many shortcuts that I had never tried before. I learned how to make my cursor jump around where I need it to in VS Code.
